# RB3toRB2
![RB3toRB2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C0Assassin/RB3toRB2/main/dependencies/3to2.png)


Complete recreation of Rock Band 3s venues/animations/lipsyncing in Rock Band 2s midi/milo format. Disc songs only.

Venue lighting/cameras are recreated by hand and events are timed beat for beat.
When applicable, MOGGs are either recreated or use the actual RB3 moggs. Moggs are sometimes recreated so as to add some extras that weren't present in RB3 originally. (Custom crowd trackings.)


DO NOT USE ONYX ON THESE FOR ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ARE CONVERTING TO PS3. THEY WILL WORK ON RB2/RB1.
